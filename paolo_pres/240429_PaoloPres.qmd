## Ongoing research projects

-   Temperature and air-pollution interaction on COPD hospital admissions
-   Early warnings for Dengue outbreaks in Sri Lanka and Nepal
-   Excess mortality during the climate crisis
-   Spatial vulnerabilities to heat in Greece

## Temperature and air-pollution interaction

-   Examine the effect modification of on temperature
-   Examine this effect modification by age and sex
-   Calculate number of hospitalisations attributed to this interaction PM10, PM2.5, NO2 and O3

**Outcome:** Daily COPD hospitalisations as retrieved from SAHSU during 2002-2021. The analysis will be stratified by age and sex.

## Stage

-   I have collected and cleaned all the data
-   Agreed on the statistical analysis plan
-   To do during summer: develop the model and conduct the analysis

## Early warnings for Dengue outbreaks in Sri Lanka and Nepal

-   Collaboration with WHO, Dr Dorigatti and Prof Ferguson
-   Develop Bayesian spatiotemporal models to predict Dengue outbreaks in Sri Lanka and Nepal
-   Explore the importance of meteorological factors to the predictions
-   Assess time windows of accurate predictions

## Temperature

## Statistical model

$P(s, t)$ - Population in spatial unit $S$ at week $t$

$X_i(s, t)$ - Mean temperature, precipitation and humidity in spatial unit $S$ at week $t$

$Y(s, t)$ - number of Dengue cases in spatial unit $S$ at week $t$

$$
\begin{align}
Y(s, t) &\sim \text{Poisson}(\mu(s, t)P(s, t))) \\
\mu(s, t) &= \beta_0 + \sum_if(X_i(s, t)) + w(s) + u(t) + v(t_*) 
\end{align}
$$

## Results

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| message: false
#| warning: false
library(tidyverse)

mod <- readRDS("mod2.rds")
dat <- readRDS("datfin.rds")

set.seed(11)
pred <- rpois(n = nrow(dat), lambda = mod$summary.fitted.values$`0.5quant`)

data.frame(
  truth = dat$ncases, 
  predicted = pred) %>% 
  ggplot() + geom_point(aes(x=truth, y = predicted)) + 
  geom_abline(slope = 1, intercept = 0, col = "blue") +
  ylim(c(0, 2000)) + xlim(c(0, 2000)) +
  theme_bw()

```

## Predictive ability

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| message: false
#| warning: false

dat$pred <- pred

dat %>% 
  group_by(week) %>% 
  summarise(truth=sum(ncases), 
            pred=sum(pred)) %>% 
  ggplot() + 
  geom_point(aes(x=week, y=truth), col = "blue") + 
   geom_point(aes(x=week, y=pred), col = "red") + 
  theme_bw()

```

## Excess mortality during the climate crisis

-   Develop a framework to estimate excess mortality during summer 2022 in Switzerland
-   Revisions in Scientific Reports

<center>![](Fig2.PNG)</center>

## Medical research foundation grant

-   Organise an international consortium to develop guidelines for estimating excess mortality

-   First meeting in London in 2025

-   Apply the framework to different European countries.

## Spatial vulnerabilities to heat in Greece

-   EURISE project, collaboration with stakeholders in Greece, Dr Filippidis and Dr Evangelopoulos
-   Quantify spatial vulnerabilities to heat in Greece
-   Examine interactions with smoking patterns
-   Stage: Data collected, project starts in mid June

## Other projects

-   Supervision of MSc students: development of methodology capturing non-linear effects of heat
-   Leading a working package for a Wellcome bid assessing temperature and mental health
-   Writing a grant assessing the impact of pollen on CVDs
-   Getting married in 30th of August :)
